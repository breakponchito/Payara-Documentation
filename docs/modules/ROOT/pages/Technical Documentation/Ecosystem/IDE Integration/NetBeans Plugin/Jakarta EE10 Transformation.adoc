This will create a destination folder named *payara-sample* with the transformed file into it:

To verify the resulting file you'll have to open it using either Netbeans or a different editor:

[[transform-single-file-same-location]]
== Transform a Single File in the same Location

It is possible to save the transformed file in the same location where the original resides.

To do this, select the source location and then mark the *Override* option. This will disable and clean the target value, finally select *Finish*:

Once the file has been transformed, it will override the file. You can open with either Netbeans or a different editor:

[[transform-all-files-folder]]
== Transform all files in a Folder

You can transform all source code files located in a folder. To do this you must select the source folder and the new destination folder, finally click *Finish*:

NOTE: The IDE will also show a dialog with additional recommendations to configure the source code's project POM configuration. These configuration changes will have to be done manually if required.

This will create a destination folder named *payara-sample* with the transformed folder and the contents into it:

image::netbeans-plugin/transform-to-jakartaee10/target-folder-created-with-files.png[Folder created with files]

Automatically Netbeans will open the project and you can verify results within the IDE:

[[transform-folder-same-location]]
== Transform all files in a Folder in the same Location

It is possible to save all transformed files in the same location where the originals reside.

To do this you should select the source folder and then mark the *Override* option, finally click *Finish*:

image::netbeans-plugin/transform-to-jakartaee10/select-override-folder.png[Select override folder]

Once the contents of the folder have been transformed, the new files will override the current ones and the IDE will open the project to verify results:
