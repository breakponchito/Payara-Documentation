= Upgrade Advisor Tool

This is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to advise changes added in Jakarta 10 that affect applications based on Jakarta 8 or 9. The idea of the tool is to summarize all changes that affect your application from the different Jakarta Specs with messages on the logs indicating what code was removed or changed for the different specs listed here: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/

IMPORTANT: Something important to note is that not all the specs add changes between versions, that is why for the current version some specs wonâ€™t show any advises for the implementation code.

[[hot-to-use]]
== How to use

You can use directly from command line without configuring anything on your local environment. This is resolved by maven central because this tool was uploaded under the following link: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/fish.payara.advisor/advisor-maven-plugin[Upgrade Advisor Tool on Maven Central]. 

You must go to the root of your project folder and execute the following command:

[source, shell]
----
mvn fish.payara.advisor:advisor-maven-plugin:1.0:advise
----

Then you will see results from logs:

=== Structure of the Upgrade Advisor logs

The structure of the advisor messages include the following:

|===
|Structure | Description

|line 1
|

|Type of message
|This can be INFO, WARNING or ERROR

|Line of code
|To indicate where to locate the occurrence of the advisory

|Expression
|The Code Expression that cause the ocurrence of the advisory, for example: method declaration, method call, annotation property, etc.

|line 2
|

|Source file
|The file name where to locate the advisory

|line 3
|

|Issue message
|Message to indicate what issue is causing the advisory

|line 4
|

|How to proceed message
|Message to indicate what is the recommended way to proceed with the advisory to make the application compatible with Jakarta 10

|===

IMPORTANT: The log messages for the advisors are (ASCII) colour-coded to make the user more apprehensive about what they need to change.

The following are examples of each of the available types of advisors with the different colors in their structure.

[[example-1-info-message]]
==== Example INFO message

[[example-2-warning-message]]
==== Example WARNING message

image::advisor-tool/advisor-warning-message.png[Advisor WARNING message]

[[example-3-error-message]]
==== Example ERROR message

=== Code Example

To exemplify this better, suppose you have the following code:

[source, java]
----
package jsonb;                                      

import jakarta.json.bind.annotation.JsonbProperty;

public class JsonBeanTest {
    
    @JsonbProperty(nillable = true)
    private String name;
}
----

For Jakarta 10 the property nillable was marked as deprecated, as a modification for Jakarta JSON Binding 3.0, you can check here: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/jsonb/3.0/[Jakarta JSON Binding 3.0]

Now with the use of the Upgrade Advisor Tool we can get the advise related to this change as follows:

image::advisor-tool/advisor-json-binding.png[Advisor JSON Binding]

From the message we can see that the recommendation is to start to use the new annotation JsonbNillable. Then we can have the following code by applying the advise from the tool:

[source, java]
----
package jsonb;

import jakarta.json.bind.annotation.JsonbNillable;
import jakarta.json.bind.annotation.JsonbProperty;

public class JsonBeanTest {
    
    @JsonbProperty
    @JsonbNillable
    private String name;
}
----

As as conclusion this tool will help us to make our old Jakarta 8/9 applications compatible with last changes added in Jakarta 10.
